Spock – full name generally considered unpronounceable to Humans – was a male Human/Vulcan hybrid who became one of the
most distinguished and respected figures in the United Federation of Planets. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise",
"Journey to Babel"; TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II"; VOY: "Alliances", "Endgame")

As a Starfleet officer in the 23rd century, he served aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer under
Captain Christopher Pike, as first officer and science officer under
Captain James T. Kirk, and as the commanding officer of the Enterprise during its tenure as a training ship.

In the 24th century, Spock became an adviser to the leadership of the Federation and a celebrated ambassador on their
behalf. He disappeared in 2387 after saving the Federation from a supernova that destroyed Romulus and caused the
creation of the alternate reality. (TOS: "The Cage", "Where No Man Has Gone Before"; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan;
TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II"; Star Trek)
