42 is the atomic number of molybdenum.
42 is the atomic mass of one of the naturally occurring stable isotopes of calcium.
The angle rounded to whole degrees for which a rainbow appears (the critical angle).
In 1966, mathematician Paul Cooper theorized that the fastest, most efficient way to travel across continents would be
to bore a straight hollow tube directly through the Earth, connecting a set of antipodes, remove the air from the tube
and fall through.[8] The first half of the journey consists of free-fall acceleration, while the second half consists of
an exactly equal deceleration. The time for such a journey works out to be 42 minutes. Even if the tube does not pass
through the exact center of the Earth, the time for a journey powered entirely by gravity (known as a gravity train)
always works out to be 42 minutes, so long as the tube remains friction-free, as while the force of gravity would be
lessened, the distance traveled is reduced at an equal rate.[9][10] (The same idea was proposed, without calculation
by Lewis Carroll in 1893 in Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.[11]) Now we know that is not true, and it only would take about 38 minutes.
As determined by the Babylonians, in 79 years Mars orbits the Sun almost exactly 42 times.
