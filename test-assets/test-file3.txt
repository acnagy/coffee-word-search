Final Fantasy XV takes place on the fictional world of Eos;
aside from the capital of Lucis, all the world is dominated by the empire of Niflheim,
who seek control of the magical Crystal protected by Lucis's royal family. On the eve of peace negotiations,
Niflheim attacks the capital and steals the Crystal. Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the Lucian throne, goes on a quest to
rescue the Crystal and defeat Niflheim. He later learns his full role as the "True King", destined to use the Crystal's
powers to save Eos from eternal darkness. The game shares a thematic connection with Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy,
a subseries of games linked by a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Type-0
